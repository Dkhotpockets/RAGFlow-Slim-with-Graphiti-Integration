# Crawl4AI Integration Specification

## Overview
Integrate Crawl4AI web crawling capabilities into the RAGFlow Slim with Graphiti Integration system to enable automatic ingestion of web content for enhanced knowledge base building.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Web Content Crawling**: Ability to crawl websites and extract structured content
2. **Content Processing**: Convert crawled web content into format suitable for RAGFlow ingestion
3. **Entity Extraction**: Use Graphiti to extract entities and relationships from web content
4. **Knowledge Graph Enhancement**: Add web-sourced relationships to the existing Neo4j knowledge graph
5. **API Integration**: REST endpoints for triggering crawls and managing crawled content

### User Stories
- As a developer, I want to crawl documentation websites to keep my knowledge base current
- As a researcher, I want to crawl news sources for real-time information
- As a system administrator, I want to schedule automated crawls of trusted sources
- As an AI assistant, I want to access web content through the existing RAGFlow API

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- Crawl4AI service as separate container in docker-compose.yml
- REST API endpoints in main Flask app for crawl management
- Integration with existing Supabase vector storage and Neo4j graph database
- Async processing for long-running crawls

### Data Flow
1. User submits crawl request via API
2. Crawl4AI processes URLs and extracts content
3. Content sent to RAGFlow ingestion pipeline
4. Graphiti extracts entities and relationships
5. Data stored in Supabase (vectors) and Neo4j (graph)

### API Endpoints
- `POST /crawl` - Start a new crawl job
- `GET /crawl/{job_id}` - Check crawl status
- `GET /crawl/jobs` - List recent crawl jobs
- `DELETE /crawl/{job_id}` - Cancel crawl job

### Configuration
- Environment variables for Crawl4AI settings
- Rate limiting and politeness settings
- Content filtering rules
- Storage limits and cleanup policies

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Crawl processing should not block main RAGFlow operations
- Reasonable timeout limits for crawl operations
- Efficient content processing and storage

### Security
- Respect robots.txt and website terms of service
- Rate limiting to avoid overwhelming target websites
- Content validation and sanitization
- Access controls for crawl operations

### Reliability
- Error handling for failed crawls
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Logging and monitoring of crawl operations
- Graceful degradation if Crawl4AI service is unavailable

## Dependencies
- Crawl4AI library
- Additional Python packages for web scraping
- Docker container for Crawl4AI service
- Updates to docker-compose.yml and requirements.txt

## Testing
- Unit tests for crawl processing logic
- Integration tests for end-to-end crawl workflow
- Mock external websites for testing
- Performance tests for crawl operations

## Documentation
- API documentation for new endpoints
- Configuration guide for Crawl4AI settings
- Usage examples and best practices
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
