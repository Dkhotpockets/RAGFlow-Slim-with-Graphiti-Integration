# Tasks: Crawl4AI Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/master/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, api-contracts.md

**Tests**: Include comprehensive testing following Test-First principle
**Organization**: Tasks grouped by implementation phase for systematic development

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: Files at repository root
- **Tests**: test_*.py files alongside implementation
- **API**: app.py for main endpoints

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Initialize Crawl4AI integration infrastructure

- [ ] T001 Add Crawl4AI dependency to requirements.txt
- [ ] T002 [P] Create database migration for crawl_jobs and crawl_content tables
- [ ] T003 [P] Add environment variables for Crawl4AI configuration
- [ ] T004 [P] Update docker-compose.yml with Crawl4AI service

## Phase 2: Core Implementation (Crawl Service)

**Purpose**: Implement the core crawling functionality

- [ ] T005 Create crawl service module in crawl_service.py
- [ ] T006 Implement CrawlJob and CrawlConfig data models
- [ ] T007 Implement CrawlResult data model with content processing
- [ ] T008 Add async crawl processing with timeout handling
- [ ] T009 Implement robots.txt compliance and rate limiting
- [ ] T010 Add content sanitization and size limits

---

## Phase 3: API Endpoints (REST Interface)

**Purpose**: Create REST API for crawl management

- [ ] T011 Add POST /api/v1/crawl/jobs endpoint to app.py
- [ ] T012 Add GET /api/v1/crawl/jobs/{job_id} endpoint
- [ ] T013 Add GET /api/v1/crawl/jobs endpoint with pagination
- [ ] T014 Add DELETE /api/v1/crawl/jobs/{job_id} endpoint
- [ ] T015 Add GET /api/v1/crawl/stats endpoint
- [ ] T016 Implement request/response validation using data models
- [ ] T017 Add error handling and status codes

---

## Phase 4: Integration (Graphiti & Storage)

**Purpose**: Integrate with existing RAGFlow pipeline

- [ ] T018 Integrate with Graphiti for entity extraction from crawled content
- [ ] T019 Add Supabase vector storage for crawled content embeddings
- [ ] T020 Add Neo4j relationship storage for crawled entities
- [ ] T021 Implement content deduplication using hash comparison
- [ ] T022 Add crawl job status tracking and persistence

---

## Phase 5: Testing (Quality Assurance)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing following Test-First principle

### Unit Tests
- [ ] T023 [P] Create test_crawl_service.py for crawl logic testing
- [ ] T024 [P] Create test_crawl_models.py for data model validation
- [ ] T025 [P] Create test_crawl_api.py for endpoint testing

### Integration Tests
- [ ] T026 Create test_crawl_integration.py for end-to-end workflow
- [ ] T027 Add mock web server for testing crawl operations
- [ ] T028 Test Graphiti integration with crawled content
- [ ] T029 Test Supabase/Neo4j storage integration

### Performance Tests
- [ ] T030 Add performance tests for crawl timeout handling
- [ ] T031 Test concurrent crawl operations
- [ ] T032 Validate content size limits and processing

---

## Phase 6: Documentation & Polish

**Purpose**: Complete the implementation with documentation and refinements

- [ ] T033 Update openapi.yaml with new crawl endpoints
- [ ] T034 Create crawl configuration documentation
- [ ] T035 Add usage examples and best practices
- [ ] T036 Update README.md with crawl integration details
- [ ] T037 Add troubleshooting guide for common crawl issues
- [ ] T038 Implement monitoring and logging for production use
- [ ] T039 Add content filtering and quality validation
- [ ] T040 Final integration testing and bug fixes
