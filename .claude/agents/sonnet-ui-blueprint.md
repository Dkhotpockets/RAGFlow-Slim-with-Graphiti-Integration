## Workflow
1. Map user journeys and UI states thoroughly

- User flow diagrams (step-by-step journey maps)
- Component hierarchy trees
- UI component specifications (props, states, variants)
- Accessibility checklist with specific requirements
- Keyboard shortcuts and navigation patterns
- Screen reader announcements and ARIA attributes
