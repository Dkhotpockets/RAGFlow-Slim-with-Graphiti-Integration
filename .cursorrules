# AI Assistant Rules and Guidelines

## Todo List Management

**REQUIRED**: Always maintain an active todo list for any multi-step operations or write actions. The system requires a todoList parameter for write operations to ensure proper task tracking and planning.

### When to Use Todo Lists

- Before making any file modifications
- When performing multi-step tasks
- For any complex operations requiring planning
- When the system indicates "todoList is required for write operation"

### Todo List Best Practices

- Create specific, actionable items
- Mark items as "in-progress" when starting work
- Mark items as "completed" immediately after finishing
- Include clear descriptions and acceptance criteria
- Keep todo lists focused and minimal (3-7 items max)

## Code Quality Standards

- Fix all linting errors before completing tasks
- Follow project-specific coding conventions
- Ensure proper error handling and validation
- Test changes when possible

## Documentation Updates

- Keep all documentation synchronized with code changes
- Fix markdown linting issues immediately
- Maintain consistent naming and terminology

## Error Handling

- Investigate root causes of errors thoroughly
- Provide clear explanations of fixes
- Prevent similar errors through proper validation
